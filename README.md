# Wheelkeepers

A browser arcade game for the Squeekchain community. Guide a collector around a hamster wheel, catch seeds, avoid glitches, and survive as the pace increases.

**[Play Wheelkeepers](https://wheelkeepers.dpdns.org/)**

## How to play

- Move the mouse around the wheel to aim. On a phone, hold and drag on the playfield.
- Arrow keys and A/D are also supported.
- Catch seeds to earn points and avoid glitches to protect your three hearts.
- The run continues until you lose all hearts, with increasing difficulty.

Practice is available without a wallet. Connect an Ethereum wallet and sign a message to enter the leaderboard. Playing does not require tokens, gas, transaction approvals, or NFT ownership. Wallet addresses used for ranked play are visible on the public leaderboard.

## Squeekchain integration

Live courses use data from the official Squeekchain status feed. The game shows the feed's availability and offers practice mode when live data is unavailable.

## Boost events

A fresh hardware transition from resting to running opens a shared 90-second entry window. Each Boost lasts up to 75 seconds (or three lost hearts). The event freezes the seed and starting RPM for all participants: slow wheels produce arcs, faster wheels produce spirals. A 12-seed golden orbit appears at 12, 30, 48 and 66 seconds; catching the full sequence awards +500 points.

Exit or Escape immediately returns to the arcade. Exited runs are abandoned without submitting a score. Existing seeds and glitches finish their flights before the golden sequence reaches the collector; charging never clears the field.

The entry window and any started run survive a hamster rest or an unavailable feed. Continued running does not continually create events. Event detection follows visitor polling; activity entirely between observations can be missed. The hardware signal is persisted in D1 so concurrent visitors and Worker restarts share one event.

Sign in before joining a live Boost to save a server-verified score to that event's leaderboard. These scores never enter the ordinary all-time board. **Practice Boost** in the Squeekchain card is a clearly labelled, always-available practice run with a separate device best; it does not simulate a hardware event or submit a score.

After updating, apply the new D1 migration before serving the updated app. The local command below applies it only to the development database.

## Run locally

Requires Node.js 22.13 or newer and npm.

```sh
npm ci
npm run db:migrate:local
npm run dev
```

Open [localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173/).

Local development uses a local database. The migrations do not connect to the deployed game's database. No production credentials are required.
## Checks

```sh
npm run typecheck
npm test
npm run build
```

With the local dev server running, `node --experimental-strip-types tests/boost-integration.mjs` verifies a full 75-second event run against local D1 and removes its disposable account and fixtures afterward.
